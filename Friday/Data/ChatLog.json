These images can be downloaded for free or used for various projects.\n\nIf you're asking whether dogs can imagine or see images, the answer is no. Dogs can't see in two dimensions, such as in film or paper photographs. Their eyes work differently than humans, and they perceive the world in a unique way.\n\nHowever, if you show a digital image on a screen, dogs might be able to recognize and respond to the image, especially if it's of something familiar to them, like a treat or a toy.\n\nPlease let me know if I'm correct in understanding your question or if you need further clarification!"

You can make a test run, then check your archive, use the \"X\" reaction, and check your archive again. If it's gone, it's deleted.\n\nAdditionally, if you want to delete generated images from your server, you can delete unattached files from the media library and then use \"Force regenerate thumbnails\" to delete the thumbnails that are no longer needed.\n\nLastly, there's a media command called \"prune\" that can be used to remove all generated images. This command has an optional flag \"--remove-abandoned\" to get rid of thumbnails that can't be regenerated.\n\nPlease let me know if you need more specific guidance on deleting generated images in your particular situation."
